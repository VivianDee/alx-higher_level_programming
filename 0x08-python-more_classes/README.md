# Python - More Classes and Objects

This repository provides a collection of Python programs that cover various topics related to Python classes and objects. Each program is designed to demonstrate and practice specific concepts and techniques. Here, you will find a brief overview of the topics covered in this repository, as well as a description of the tasks implemented in each program.

## Topics Covered

1. **Object Oriented Programming (OOP):** 

2. **Class and Instance Attributes:**

3. **Classmethods and staticmethods:** 

4. **Properties vs. Getters and Setters:** 

5. **str vs repr:**

## Program Descriptions

Below is a brief description of each program included in this repository, along with the tasks implemented in each program.

1. **`0-rectangle.py`**: This program defines an empty class called `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.

2. **`1-rectangle.py`**: This program defines a class called `Retangle` that defines a rectangle. It includes two private instance attributes `width` and `height` and it add validation for the width and height

3. **`2-rectangle.py`**: This program extends the `Retangle` class from the previous program. It includes two public instance methods `area()` and `perimeter()` that calculates and returns the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

4. **`3-rectangle.py`**: This program further extends the `Rectangle` class. It includes method that allows print() and str() to print the rectangle with the character #.

5. **`4-rectangle.py`**: This program extends the `Rectangle` class by adding a method that allows repr() to print string representation of the rectangle .

6. **`5-rectangle.py`**: This program builds upon the previous version of the `Rectangle` class. It adds a method that prints the message "Bye rectangle..."  when an instance of Rectangle is deleted.

7. **`6-rectangle.py`**: This program extends the `Rectangle` class by introducing a new public class attribute called `number_of_instances` that returns the number of created instances of the class.

8. **`7-rectangle.py`**: This program extends the `Rectangle` class by introducing a new public class attribute called `print_symbol` determines the symbol used for the string rpresentation.

9. **`8-rectangle.py`**: This program extends the `Rectangle` class by introducing a new static method called `bigger_or_equal` which takes in two arguments and  returns the biggest rectangle based on the area.

10. **`9-rectangle.py`**: This program extends the `Rectangle` class by introducing a new class method called `square` that returns a new Rectangle instance with width == height == size.

11. **`101-nqueens.py`**: This program that solves the N queens problem. The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NN chessboard.
