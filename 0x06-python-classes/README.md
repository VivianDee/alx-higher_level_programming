# Python Programming Basics

This repository provides a collection of Python programs that cover various topics related to Python programming. Each program is designed to demonstrate and practice specific concepts and techniques. Here, you will find a brief overview of the topics covered in this repository, as well as a description of the tasks implemented in each program.

## Topics Covered

1. **Why Python programming is awesome:** 

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

3. **Attributes and Access Modifiers:** 

4. **Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding:** 

5. **Properties:**

6. **Getters and Setters:**

7. **Dynamic Attribute Creation:** 

8. **`__dict__` Attribute:** 

9. **Attribute Lookup:**

## Program Descriptions

Below is a brief description of each program included in this repository, along with the tasks implemented in each program.

1. **`square.py`**: This program defines an empty class called `Square` that represents a square shape.

2. **`0-square.py`**: This program defines a class called `Square` that represents a square shape. It includes a private instance attribute `size` and allows instantiation with a size value.

3. **`1-square.py`**: This program extends the `Square` class from the previous program. It adds validation to the size attribute, raising exceptions for invalid values.

4. **`2-square.py`**: This program further extends the `Square` class. It includes a public instance method `area()` that calculates and returns the area of the square.

5. **`3-square.py`**: This program enhances the `Square` class by adding properties for the size attribute, allowing more controlled access to the attribute.

6. **`4-square.py`**: This program builds upon the previous version of the `Square` class. It adds a public instance method `my_print()` to print a square shape using the '#' character.

7. **`5-square.py`**: This program extends the `Square` class by introducing a new attribute called `position`. It includes properties for both the `size` and `position` attributes.

8. **`node.py`**: This program defines a class called `Node` that represents a node of a singly linked list. It includes private instance attributes `data` and `next_node`.

9. **`singly_linked_list.py`**: This program defines a class called `SinglyLinkedList` that represents a singly linked list. It includes a private instance attribute `head` and a public method `sorted_insert()` to insert nodes in a sorted manner.

10. **`6-square.py`**: This program extends the `Square` class with additional features. It includes a new attribute `position` and modifies the `my_print()` method to consider the position

 when printing the square.

11. **`7-square.py`**: This program enhances the `Square` class by allowing size to be a number (integer or float). It also adds support for comparing square instances based on their areas.

12. **`magic_class.py`**: This program defines a class called `MagicClass` that replicates the functionality of a given Python bytecode. It includes methods for initializing the class, calculating area, and calculating circumference.
