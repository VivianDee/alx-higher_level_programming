# SQL - Introduction

## Description

This project covers SQL concepts and basic MySQL operations. It includes scripts for creating databases, tables, inserting and manipulating data, and more.

For this project, I learnt about
- Databases
- SQL
- MySQL

## Usage

To run the SQL scripts, you can use the following format:

```sh
cat script_name.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p database_name

Replace script_name.sql with the name of the script, localhost with the host address, root with the MySQL user, and database_name with the desired database.
